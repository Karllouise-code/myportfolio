                        I am a curious person and love to explore new
                        technologies. Iâ€™ve been coding for about 2 years, and
                        for that time I realized that I am more confident on Web
                        Development especially at frontend technologies such as
                        HTML/CSS and Sass but I also have some basic knowledge
                        backend technologies such as SQL, PHP and a framework
                        Laravel as well as on C and Java.
